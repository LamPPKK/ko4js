# This is ko4js
Kotlin for JavaScript

The sample projects show how to do Kotlin DCE and uglifyjs to get a complete js file.

uglifyjs must be installed on the system for those projects that use it. 

This repo consists of sub directories. Each directory is a complete project. 
To build a project, open the terminal and cd to the directory of your interest.
Run ./gradlew, and then open html file to see the action in the browser.
