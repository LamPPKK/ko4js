## Kotlin for JavaScript

The projects show how to code in Kotlin to generate a complete js file that works in the browser and nodejs.

This repo consists of sub directories. Each directory is a complete standalone project.
 
Project build is done with Gradle Kotlin DSL. To build a browser project, open the terminal and cd to the directory of your interest. Run <code>./gradlew</code>, and then open html file to see the action in the browser.
