Kotlin for JavaScript

I started writing a blog about 
Kotlin for JavaScript https://ibinti.com/kotlin-for-javascript

This sample project shows how to use Kotlin DCE and uglifyjs to get a small bundle.

Gradle build utilizes uglifyjs. uglifyjs must be installed on the system. 

To build the project, simply run ./gradlew.
